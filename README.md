## üìò Project Description

**Obstacle Avoiding Eye Glasses** is a smart wearable device designed to assist visually impaired individuals in detecting nearby obstacles.  
Using an **ultrasonic sensor** for distance measurement and a **buzzer** for sound feedback, the system alerts the user of obstacles within a defined range, helping ensure safer navigation.

**(‚âà350 characters)**  
A smart wearable device using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles for visually impaired users. It measures distance and triggers buzzer alerts when objects are close, assisting in navigation and safety. Built using Arduino Uno, HC-SR04 sensor, and basic digital logic design.

## üß∞ Components & Tools

| Component | Function |
|------------|-----------|
| **Arduino Uno** | Main microcontroller board |
| **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** | Detects obstacle distance |
| **Buzzer** | Provides audio alert |
| **Jumper Wires** | Circuit connections |
| **Breadboard** | Prototype wiring |
| **Arduino IDE** | Programming and uploading code |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

1. The **ultrasonic sensor** emits sound waves and measures the time taken for the echo to return.  
2. The **Arduino** calculates the distance using the speed of sound.  
3. If an object is detected within a **preset threshold distance**, the **buzzer** is activated.  
4. The buzzer‚Äôs sound frequency or pattern changes based on proximity ‚Äî closer obstacles produce faster beeps.

#define TRIG 9
#define ECHO 10
#define BUZZER 8

void setup() {
  pinMode(TRIG, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ECHO, INPUT);
  pinMode(BUZZER, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  long duration, distance;
  digitalWrite(TRIG, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  digitalWrite(TRIG, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(TRIG, LOW);
  duration = pulseIn(ECHO, HIGH);
  distance = (duration * 0.034) / 2;

  if (distance < 30) { // obstacle closer than 30 cm
    digitalWrite(BUZZER, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(BUZZER, LOW);
  }
  Serial.print("Distance: ");
  Serial.print(distance);
  Serial.println(" cm");
  delay(200);
}
